## ðŸ“‹ Summary
This project mainly aims at developing a supervised machine learning model to predict the risk of heart disease in indiviuduals.
The data contains 3390 rows and 17 columns. It is based on an ongoing study in Framingham, Massachusetts.

The project has been conducted in 5 steps:
1. Data Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Data Transformation
4. Model Building and Evaluation
5. Hyperparameter Tuning

Engineered an important feature of pulse pressure using systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

The result is a XGBoost model with almost 87% accuracy, 89% precision and 84% recall.
